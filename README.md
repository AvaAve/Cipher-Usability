This is the Cipher Usability project I created during the Girls Who Code 2025 Summer Pathways Program. The Cipher Usability project is basically an upgrade/continuation of "Programming Caesar's Cipher", but its own project. This cipher tool allows for the encryption and decryption of accepted messages, which now includes a wider selection of characters. Enhancements for this project include the added avaliable characters for use in the input message prompt, and that the key selection now goes up to 93 instead of 25. I always have a bit of trouble with these conditionals and the loops, I'm also still learning proper organization for my code, so that's a bit of a slowdown. But with every project I make, I get a little more familiar with the code used in it and how to make my own in the future. Originally created on Replit in Python, Cipher Usability is the fourth of five Python Cybersecurity projects from Pathways.

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Import the string library to access more characters.
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the initialMessage (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Define and call a function called encryptOrDecrypt() that stores a conditional statement to encrypt or decrypt the initialMessage based on user input.
- Define and call a function called wraparound() that stores a conditional statement to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Share the shiftedMessage with the user.

### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Add another usability feature.
- Add a while loop to repeat the program.
- Explore other ciphers.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

README.md file give you more documentation and information about a program. They are super helpful for describing what a program should do, any issues you've encountered, changes you want to make, and more. 

### ← main.py
This is where you will write your main program.
